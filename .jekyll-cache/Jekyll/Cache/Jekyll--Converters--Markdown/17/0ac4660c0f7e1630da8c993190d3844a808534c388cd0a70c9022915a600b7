Today, I am working as a Senior Consultant for Azure, DevOps and .NET solutions in Bangalore. I am mostly passionate about software architecture, cloud technologies and IOT.</p>

<p>My goals
I made this website as a kind of knowledge base for myself. When I read about something interesting or learn anything I will write about it. I think when writing about a topic you concentrate more and therefore have better study results. The second reason why I made this website is, that I love teaching and I hope that people find their way on here and can benefit from my posts.</p>
