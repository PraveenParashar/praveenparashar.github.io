    "snippet": "Reference LinksBinary Mathematics:Binary mathematics is the heart of the computer and an essential math field for computer programming. For all mathematical concepts, the binary number system uses only two digits, 0 and 1. It simplifies the coding process and is essential for low-level instructions used in hardware programming. Computers store data using the binary system. The information we store on computers, from pictures to games and even videos, is stored using the binary number system.Linear Algebra:Linear Algebra is the language of machine learning. The heartbeat of the computer is in linear algebra. This branch of mathematics provides concepts crucial to many areas of computer science, including graphics, image processing, cryptography, machine learning, computer vision, optimization, graph algorithms, quantum computation, computational biology, information retrieval and web search. Linear algebra is what makes your video games look so breathtaking, and answers whatever questions you may be asking!Calculus:Calculus is a branch of mathematics. It studies the rate at which change occurs. It is often used in computer graphics, scientific computing, problem-solving applications, game programming and computer security.Calculus is the examination of continuous change and the rate change occurs. It is used in an array of computer science areas, including creating graphs or visuals, simulations, problem-solving applications, coding in applications, creating statistic solvers, and the design and analysis of algorithms. There are two different types of calculus: integral calculus and differential calculus. Together, these disciplines help you to figure out the rate of change, which is an important ingredient in many algorithms and programs.Differential equations are particularly important. A differential equation calculates how something changes and how fast that happens, so a computer can predict future outputsDiscrete mathematics:This mathematical discipline is the backbone of Computer Science. Discrete mathematics studies mathematical structures. Its nature is distinct and separable, covering logic, probability, combinatorics, trees, set theory, algorithms, and graphs. It is also called Decision Mathematics or finite mathematics sometimes, it works with the objects that can have distinct separate values. It is accounted as a very effective approach for developing and problem-solving strength.Statistics:This branch of mathematics is used for several things, including data mining, data compression, image analysis, and artificial intelligence. Statistics have been especially useful in speech recognition software like Apple’s Siri. Upon receiving your request, Siri records the frequencies and sound waves from your voice and translates them into a code. Siri then breaks down the code to identify particular patterns, phrases, and keywords. Statistics also back programs such as Google Translate, which uses data to perform online translations. Statistics help computers process massive amounts of information in the blink of an eye. You can thank statistics for revolutionizing the way we use computers!from geeksforgeeksgeeksforgeeks mathematical-algorithms"

    "snippet": "ASP.NET Core: Built-in IoC ContainerASP.NET Core framework includes built-in IoC container for automatic dependency injection. The built-in IoC container is a simple yet effective container. Let’s understand how the built-in IoC container works internally.The followings are important interfaces and classes for built-in IoC container:Interfaces:IServiceProviderIServiceCollectionClasses:ServiceProviderServiceCollectionServiceDescriptionServiceCollectionServiceExtensionsServiceCollectionContainerBuilderExtensionsThe following diagram illustrates the relationship between these classes:built-in IoC ContainerIServiceCollectionAs you know, we can register application services with built-in IoC container in the Configure method of Startup class by using IServiceCollection. IServiceCollection interface is an empty interface. It just inherits IList. See the source code here.The ServiceCollection class implements IServiceCollection interface. See the ServiceCollection source code here.So, the services you add in the IServiceCollection type instance, it actually creates an instance of ServiceDescriptor and adds it to the list.IServiceProviderIServiceProvider includes GetService method. The ServiceProvider class implements IServiceProvider interface which returns registered services with the container. We cannot instantiate ServiceProvider class because its constructors are marked with internal access modifier.ServiceCollectionServiceExtensionsThe ServiceCollectionServiceExtensions class includes extension methods related to service registrations which can be used to add services with lifetime. AddSingleton, AddTransient, AddScoped extension methods defined in this class.ServiceCollectionContainerBuilderExtensionsServiceCollectionContainerBuilderExtensions class includes BuildServiceProvider extension method which creates and returns an instance of ServiceProvider.There are three ways to get an instance of IServiceProvider:Using IApplicationBuilderWe can get the services in Configure method using IApplicationBuilder’s ApplicationServices property as shown below.public void Configure(IServiceProvider pro, IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env){    var services = app.ApplicationServices;    var logger = services.GetService&amp;lt;ILog&amp;gt;() }   .... }Using HttpContextvar services = HttpContext.RequestServices;var log = (ILog)services.GetService(typeof(ILog));Using IServiceCollectionpublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services){    var serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();}REFERENCE LINK-here"

    "snippet": "The following table presents authentication Azure AD integration with legacy authentication protocols and their capabilities reference OAuth 2.0 authentication with Azure Active Directoryhe OAuth 2.0 is the industry protocol for authorization. It allows a user to grant limited access to its protected resources. Designed to work specifically with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), OAuth separates the role of the client from the resource owner. The client requests access to the resources controlled by the resource owner and hosted by the resource server. The resource server issues access tokens with the approval of the resource owner. The client uses the access tokens to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.OAuth 2.0 is directly related to OpenID Connect (OIDC). Since OIDC is an authentication and authorization layer built on top of OAuth 2.0, it isn’t backwards compatible with OAuth 1.0. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) supports all OAuth 2.0 flows.Components of systemUser: Requests a service from the web application (app). The user is typically the resource owner who owns the data and has the power to allow clients to access the data or resource.Web browser: The web browser that the user interacts with is the OAuth client.Web app: The web app, or resource server, is where the resource or data resides. It trusts the authorization server to securely authenticate and authorize the OAuth client.Azure AD: Azure AD is the authorization server, also known as the Identity Provider (IdP). It securely handles anything to do with the user’s information, their access, and the trust relationship. It’s responsible for issuing the tokens that grant and revoke access to resources.OpenID Connect authentication with Azure Active DirectoryOpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol based on the OAuth2 protocol (which is used for authorization). OIDC uses the standardized message flows from OAuth2 to provide identity services.The design goal of OIDC is “making simple things simple and complicated things possible”. OIDC lets developers authenticate their users across websites and apps without having to own and manage password files. This provides the app builder with a secure way to verify the identity of the person currently using the browser or native app that is connected to the application.The authentication of the user must take place at an identity provider where the user’s session or credentials will be checked. To do that, you need a trusted agent. Native apps usually launch the system browser for that purpose. Embedded views are considered not trusted since there’s nothing to prevent the app from snooping on the user password.In addition to authentication, the user can be asked for consent. Consent is the user’s explicit permission to allow an application to access protected resources. Consent is different from authentication because consent only needs to be provided once for a resource. Consent remains valid until the user or admin manually revokes the grant.Use Whenhere is a need for user consent and for web sign in.#### Components of systemUser: Requests a service from the application.Trusted agent: The component that the user interacts with. This trusted agent is usually a web browser.Application: The application, or Resource Server, is where the resource or data resides. It trusts the identity provider to securely authenticate and authorize the trusted agent.Azure AD: The OIDC provider, also known as the identity provider, securely manages anything to do with the user’s information, their access, and the trust relationships between parties in a flow. It authenticates the identity of the user, grants and revokes access to resources, and issues tokens.Microsoft identity platform and OpenID Connect protocolOpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol built on OAuth 2.0 that you can use to securely sign in a user to an application. When you use the Microsoft identity platform’s implementation of OpenID Connect, you can add sign-in and API access to your apps. This article shows how to do this independent of language and describes how to send and receive HTTP messages without using any Microsoft open-source libraries.OpenID Connect extends the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol for use as an authentication protocol, so that you can do single sign-on using OAuth. OpenID Connect introduces the concept of an ID token, which is a security token that allows the client to verify the identity of the user. The ID token also gets basic profile information about the user. It also introduces the UserInfo endpoint, an API that returns information about the user.The most basic sign-in flow has the steps shown in the next diagram. Each step is described in detail in this article.for more Reference reference Permissions and consent in the Microsoft identity platformReference reference Microsoft identity platform ID tokensreference Microsoft identity platform UserInfo endpointreference reference "

    "snippet": "In C# 8.0  you can define an implementation when you declare a member of an interface. This feature provides new capabilities where you can define default implementations for features declared in interfaces. Classes can pick when to override functionality, when to use the default functionality, and when not to declare support for discrete features.Create interfaces with implementations that describe discrete features.  Create classes that use the default implementations.  Create classes that override some or all of the default implementations.Limitations of extension methodsOne way you can implement behavior that appears as part of an interface is to define extension methods that provide the default behavior. Interfaces declare a minimum set of members while providing a greater surface area for any class that implements that interface. For example, the extension methods in Enumerable provide the implementation for any sequence to be the source of a LINQ query.Extension methods are resolved at compile time, using the declared type of the variable. Classes that implement the interface can provide a better implementation for any extension method. Variable declarations must match the implementing type to enable the compiler to choose that implementation. When the compile-time type matches the interface, method calls resolve to the extension method. Another concern with extension methods is that those methods are accessible wherever the class containing the extension methods is accessible. Classes cannot declare if they should or should not provide features declared in extension methods.Starting with C# 8.0, you can declare the default implementations as interface methods. Then, every class automatically uses the default implementation. Any class that can provide a better implementation can override the interface method definition with a better algorithm.  interface that defines the behavior for all lights  public interface ILight  {      void SwitchOn();      void SwitchOff();      bool IsOn();  }  A basic overhead light fixture might implement this interface as shown in the following code:  public class OverheadLight : ILight  {      private bool isOn;      public bool IsOn() =&amp;gt; isOn;      public void SwitchOff() =&amp;gt; isOn = false;      public void SwitchOn() =&amp;gt; isOn = true;      public override string ToString() =&amp;gt; $&quot;The light is {(isOn ? &quot;on&quot; : &quot;off&quot;)}&quot;;  }  Next, let&#39;s define the interface for a light that can automatically turn off after a timeout:  10T011public interface ITimerLight : ILight  {      Task TurnOnFor(int duration);  }    You could add a basic implementation to the overhead light, but a better solution is to modify this interface definition to provide a virtual default implementation:        public interface ITimerLight : ILight  {      public async Task TurnOnFor(int duration)      {          Console.WriteLine(&quot;Using the default interface method for the ITimerLight.TurnOnFor.&quot;);          SwitchOn();          await Task.Delay(duration);          SwitchOff();          Console.WriteLine(&quot;Completed ITimerLight.TurnOnFor sequence.&quot;);      }  }Reference tutorials:    default-interface-methods"
